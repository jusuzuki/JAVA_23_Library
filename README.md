### Discription -<br>
Catalog a library's books and let patrons check them out. Here are some user stories:<br>
<ul>
<li> As a librarian, I want to create, read, update, delete, and list books in the catalog, so that we can keep track of our inventory.</li>
<li> As a librarian, I want to search for a book by author or title, so that I can find a book when there are a lot of books in the library.</li>
<li> As a librarian, I want to enter multiple authors for a book, so that I can include accurate information in my catalog.</li>
<li> As a patron, I want to check a book out, so that I can take it home with me.</li>
<li> As a patron, I want to know how many copies of a book are on the shelf, so that I can see if any are available.</li>
<li> As a patron, I want to see a history of all the books I checked out, so that I can look up the name of that awesome sci-fi novel I read three years ago.</li>
<li> As a patron, I want to know when a book I checked out is due, so that I know when to return it.
As a librarian, I want to see a list of overdue books, so that I can call up the patron who checked them out and tell them to bring them back - OR ELSE!</li>
</ol>
